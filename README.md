# Provisioning and Deploying a 12-factor app in AWS with Terraform, shell scripts, and CI.

A 1-day hands-on training class in which participants will learn:

* AWS guest network architecture: availability zones, VPCs, subnets, security groups, routes, gateways, DNS.
* Some elements of AWS identity and access management: roles, policies.
* How to configure a simple, highly available AWS application environment with AWS autoscaling groups, load balancers, RDS, CloudWatch and X509 certificates.
* Infrastructure-as-Code with AWS and Terraform: How to configure and manage AWS infrastructure using Terraform.
* Very simple continuous deployment using shell scripts, an S3 bucket, and [Snap CI](https://snap-ci.com/).
* Why building distributed systems motivates the [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/) pattern.

Prerequisites:

* You must bring a laptop with support for bash. Linux, MacOS, or Windows 10 with Windows Subsystem for Linux installed are all fine.
* You must be comfortable using the shell / command-line.
* Please install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) BEFORE coming to class.
